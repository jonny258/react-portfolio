# React Portfolio

## Project Description

React Portfolio is a web-based portfolio application for developers. This is a React single-page application that provides a showcase of the developer's projects, skills, experiences, and ways to connect.

This portfolio provides potential employers a glimpse into what the developer has accomplished, and the application helps set the developer apart by using the latest technologies, in this case, React. The project is hosted and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## User Story

As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, you'll be able to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples, assessing whether they're a good candidate for an open position.
